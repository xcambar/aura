# Aura 0.9pre [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aurajs/aura.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aurajs/aura)

Aura is a decoupled, event-driven architecture for developing widget-based applications. It takes advantage of patterns and best practices for developing maintainable applications and gives you greater control over widget-based development. Aura gives you complete control of a widget's lifecycle, allowing developers to dynamically start, stop, reload and clean-up parts of their application as needed.

## Concepts

### The `Aura` object

Your application will be an instance of the `Aura` object.

Its responsibilities are to load extensions when the app starts and clean them up when the app stops.

### Extension

Extensions are loaded in your application when it starts. They allow you to add features to the application, and are available to the widgets through their `sandbox`.

### Core

The `core` implements aliases for DOM manipulation, templating and other lower-level utilities that pipe back to a library of choice. Aliases allow switching libraries with minimum impact on your application.

### Sandbox

A `sandbox` is just a way to implement the [facade](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#facadepatternjavascript) pattern on top of features provided by `core`. It lets you expose the parts of a JavaScript library that are safe to use instead of exposing the entire API. This is particularly useful when working in teams.

When your app starts, it will create an instance of `sandbox` in each of your widgets.

### Widget

A widget represents a unit of a page. Each widget is independent.
This means that they know nothing about each other. To make them communicate, a [Publish/Subscribe (Mediator)](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#mediatorpatternjavascript) pattern is used.


## Getting started

### Requirements

1. [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/): run `npm install -g bower` if needed
2. [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli): run `npm install -g grunt-cli` if needed

### Building Aura.js

1. Run `npm install` to install build dependencies.
2. Run `bower install` to install lib dependencies.
3. Run `grunt build` and `aura.js` will be placed in `dist/`.

### How to run tests

#### Browser

Run `grunt`. Then visit `http://localhost:8899/spec/`.

#### CLI

Run `npm test`.

### Creating an Application

The first step in creating an Aura application is to make an instance of `Aura`.

```js
var app = new Aura();
```

Now that we have our `app`, we can start it.

```js
app.start({
  widget: 'body'
});
```

This starts the app by saying that it should search for widgets anywhere in the `body` of your HTML document.

### Creating a Widget

By default widgets are retrieved from a directory called `widgets/` that must be at the same level as your HTML document.

Let's say we want to create an "hello" widget. To do that we need to create a `widgets/hello/` directory

This directory must contain:

- A `main.js` file. It will bootstrap and describe the widget. It is mandatory, no matter how small it can be.
- All the other files that your widget needs (models, templates, â€¦).

For our "hello" widget the `main.js` will be:

```js
define({
  initialize: function () {
    this.$el.html('<h1>Hello Aura</h1>');
  }
});
```

### Declaring a Widget

Add the following code to your HTML document.

```html
<div data-aura-widget="hello"></div>
```

Aura will call the `initialize` method that we have defined in `widgets/hello/main.js`.

### Creating extension

Imagine that we need an helper to reverse a string. In order to accomplish that we'll need to create an extension.

```js
define('extensions/reverse', {
  initialize: function (app) {
    app.core.util.reverse = function (string) {
      return string.split('').reverse().join('');
    };
  }
});
```

### Using extension

To make our `reserve` helper available in our app, run the following code:

```js
app.use('extensions/reverse');
```

This will call the `initialize` function of our reserve extension.

Calling `use` when your `app` is already started will throw an error.

## Project status

Aura 0.8.x was well received by the developer community, but had regular requests for a few advanced capabilities. These included individual sandboxes, declarative widgets, support for Bower and a powerful Pub/Sub implementation amongst others.

To cater for this, Aura has been getting a heavy re-write over the past few months and we anticipate releasing a beta that can be tested in April, 2013. This will be followed by detailed documentation and new demo applications.

A version of Aura currently powers the [Hull.io](http://hull.io) widget platform and we are honored to have members of that team directly contributing to the next version of the project.

## Older versions

We have recently been receiving a number of requests from developers looking for the last stable version of Aura
that demonstrated integration with Backbone. You can [view](https://github.com/aurajs/aura/tree/pre-express-lib-updates)
the sources to this 0.9.x version or grab a [tarball](https://github.com/aurajs/aura/archive/pre-express-lib-updates.tar.gz) of it.
We fully intend on showing how Aura 1.0pre works with Backbone as soon as possible.
